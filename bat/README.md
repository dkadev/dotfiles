# bat Configuration

Config files for `bat`.

This configures `bat` to use a `base16-shell` compatible color scheme instead of bringing its own scheme for syntax highlighting. This way, `bat` output will automatically follow the currently set base16-shell theme.

Since `bat` is used by a lot of tools under the hood (e.g. `delta` for paging/diffing in `git`, or as previewer in `fzf`, this will make sure that quite a lot of other tools play nicely with our terminal colors.

## Installation
Install the config files according to the instructions in this repo's top level README.md
