# Oh My Zsh Configuration

Config files for `omz`.

Some basic old plugins and a bunch of useful aliases and functions.

Also use other external plugins which I prefer to keep updated by themshelves.

[zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions):
```jsx
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

[zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git):
```jsx
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

## Installation
Install the config files according to the instructions in this repo's top level README.md
